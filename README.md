### Using AI for Markdown Formatting

If you find that formatting Markdown is a bit tedious, you can use an AI tool like ChatGPT to help you out. Just copy and paste the text you want to format into ChatGPT and ask it to format it in Markdown. It will do a pretty good job of converting your plain text into Markdown, and you can then review and edit it as needed.
